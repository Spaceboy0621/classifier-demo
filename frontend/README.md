# React 17 Typescript ESLint Boilerplate

TSLint was deprecated by [Palantir](https://medium.com/palantir/tslint-in-2019-1a144c2317a9) in favor of ESLint. Most of the boilerplate resources that currently exist on GitHub are based on older versions of React or written without Typescript in mind. This repository provides a good starting point for using Typescript and ESLint as a starting point for your next React project.

## Get Started

1. `yarn` or `npm install`
2. `yarn start` or `npm run start`

## Integration with ESLint Extension for VSCode

If your main editor of choice is Microsoft's Visual Studio Code, then installing the ESLint extension and adding these settings to your instance of VSCode
will allow you to see any ESLint warnings or errors right in your editor.

`"eslint.validate": ["javascript", "javascriptreact", "typescript", "typescriptreact"]`

## Contribute

I can't promise this will stay updated as React, Typescript, or ESLint are updated. Feel free to create a pull request if you want to add features or update dependencies. I actively watch my GitHub notifications.
